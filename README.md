# Fish Weight Multiple Linear Regression


## Introduction
A Python Machine Learning Project, the main idea of this project is predicting fish weight variable with three other variables, this includes vertical length, diameter length, and the cross length. These three variables act as the independent variable of the regression model, while fish weight acts as the dependent variable. The analysis and the regression model are available in the Jupyter Notebook format in this repository.
